The third national mapathon will take place on March 24th!
That means hundreds of new mappers will learn about humanitarian mapping, and will need some guidance to get started.

We need volunteers to help new mappers in:
- Brussels (ULB and VUB)
- Louvain-la-Neuve (UCL)
- Leuven (KUL)
- Liège (ULiège)
- Namur (UNamur)
- Mons (UMons)
- Gent (UGent)

Register [here](https://www.meetup.com/OpenStreetMap-Belgium/events/247922954/) to help out the organisation. We will get back to you !
